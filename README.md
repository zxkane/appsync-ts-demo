## How to commit
This project has [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) which requires a specific syntax for commit messages. 

The format should follow `git commit -m ":emoji: (subject) message".

Emoji's shoudl follow the format defined in [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/).

Subject should be some feature of the application or some component of development (i.e. devops, lifecycle).

The message should be descriptive and brief describing the changes made. The message must follow sentence casing.
